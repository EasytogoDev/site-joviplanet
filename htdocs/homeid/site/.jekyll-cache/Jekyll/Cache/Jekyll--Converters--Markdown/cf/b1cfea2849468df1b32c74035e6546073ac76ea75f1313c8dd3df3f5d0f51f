<p>You should only add tooltips to HTML elements that are traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive (such as links or form controls). Although arbitrary HTML elements (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span&gt;</code>s) can be made focusable by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tabindex="0"</code> attribute, this will add potentially annoying and confusing tab stops on non-interactive elements for keyboard users, and most assistive technologies currently do not announce the tooltip in this situation. Additionally, do not rely solely on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hover</code> as the trigger for your tooltip, as this will make your tooltips impossible to trigger for keyboard users.</p>
