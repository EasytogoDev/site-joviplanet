<h5 id="caveat-with-anchors">Caveat with anchors</h5>

<p>By default, browsers will treat all native form controls (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;select&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code> elements) inside a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;fieldset disabled&gt;</code> as disabled, preventing both keyboard and mouse interactions on them. However, if your form also includes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a ... class="btn btn-*"&gt;</code> elements, these will only be given a style of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pointer-events: none</code>. As noted in the section about <a href="/html-homeid/docs//components/buttons/#disabled-state">disabled state for buttons</a> (and specifically in the sub-section for anchor elements), this CSS property is not yet standardized and isnâ€™t fully supported in Internet Explorer 10, and wonâ€™t prevent keyboard users from being able to focus or activate these links. So to be safe, use custom JavaScript to disable such links.</p>
