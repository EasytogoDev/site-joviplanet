        Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It is the most
        mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world. Sass gives you the power of
        variables, mixins, functions, etc.

    <p>
        Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to
        create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.
